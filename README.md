Characterizing Which Hacker News Posts Receive the Most Comments

The current project focuses on determining what kinds of Hacker News posts receive more comments. 

Specifically, we will focus analyses on:
Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments? (Ask HN posts pose questions to the community, while Show HN posts show material, such as projects, products, etc.)
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
